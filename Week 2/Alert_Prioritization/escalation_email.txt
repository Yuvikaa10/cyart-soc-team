Dear Tier 2 SOC Team,

A critical ransomware incident has been detected on Server-X, a production system. 
The alert was generated after identifying a suspicious executable named crypto_locker.exe 
and abnormal outbound communication from source IP 192.168.1.50. 
Multiple files on the system appear to be encrypted, indicating active compromise.

The affected server has been isolated to prevent lateral movement. 
Due to the high business impact and confirmed malicious indicators, 
this incident is being escalated for advanced investigation and response.
